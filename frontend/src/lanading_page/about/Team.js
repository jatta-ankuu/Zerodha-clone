Currently, I am working on a Zerodha Clone, where I am trying to replicate the powerful features of Indiaâ€™s biggest stock broker.</p>
<p>This project is helping me improve my web development and backend skills.
I believe in learning by doing, and this project is a big step in my journey.
Just like Zerodha breaks barriers in trading, I also aim to break barriers in my learning.
My goal is to become a skilled full-stack developer and contribute to impactful projects.
This is just the beginning of my coding journey, and many more projects are on the way</p>
